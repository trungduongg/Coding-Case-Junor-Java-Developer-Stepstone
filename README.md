# Coding-Case-Junor-Java-Developer-Stepstone

Greetings!!

As you can see, there are 2 folders:

_OfficialStepstoneCC is the folder that has my official code for your Coding Case: Junior Java Developer.

_StepstoneCC is the answer that also includes receiving the GET method from Postman and uploads the result to localhost:8080. I made 
this because I was not so certain about the task. Please feel free to check this if you have interests.

Finally, thank you for this opportunity and the coding case. I hope that it was good and I will be able to meet you in person.
I am looking forward to your comments soon.

Best regards,
Trung Quoc Duong
